- is there any chance I can get paid for the period from 17th of December to 17th of jan? because I havent had a job since then, was available for work and searching for a job, but only found out on 17th tthat I could apply for student jobseeker. You could look at my IRD statements to see. Is this possible, because I am calculating over the year and finding it hard to balance expenses
