- The issue with simplifying complex subjects.
- Erases difference > [[University Reflection]]
- In essence universities currently function is as a homogenizer - and there a benefits to this method. All students should be able to for instance; create a safe building to code... (do we even achieve this?)..but they don't have to show it that same way. 
- Tutors should not be those judicators for efficacy - if tutors are simply older students. 
- Rubric's might have to change from, how effective, to does to complete. - How can we trust that 
- Moderation creates consistent marking, but does is also induce homogeneity in the marking criteria. Certain ideologies with perform better in particular classes, which I believe is an injustice to the student and crippling the creativity of our cohort. 
- There is a counter-point that suggests that difference comes from each class rather than within each class.
