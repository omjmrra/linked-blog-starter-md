The question posed was: what are the fundamental characteristics of well functioning government. 

What proceeded was 

Key Terms:

- Governance
- Framework
- Societal well-being.
- Principals


1. A well-functioning government establishes a peaceful framework where people can interact positively and are satisfied with the governance. 


Two systems:
- Set of principals remain consistent.
- Framework remains consistent.

Variables:
- Population (scale)
- Circumstance (scenario)

Products:
- Policies 
- Acts - Bills?


“The measure of success of the principle is whether it is successful between scales.”
