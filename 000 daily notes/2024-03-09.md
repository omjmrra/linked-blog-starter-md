# Thoughts:
today with all my preconceptions and tutor requirements, i was making this bio type question more complicated than i needs to be. i felt like giving up as i put myself in a closed uncalculatable loop, # they answer was deconstructing the assumptions and distill to a root, top priorities and to compromise,  
  
I have to compromise to simplify the question, no longer what do i want to make, but what can i make with the tools i have and where does that align with what i am interested in, leave the idea generation for form to a later step  
  
i think that there is a difference between the brief and the tutors understanding and the little readers for sure.  
  
deconstruction computational design we see many aspects, but root of this methodology or stages is form finding, but i seems a little disconnected at present without justification  
  
people and briefs are flawed, i need to find a way to enjoy uni and pursue interests  
  
  
  
maintain plastic mind  
  
the next step in my process is that these study serves as a physical observation of the phenomenon, and that i am not necessarily trying to reacted this digitally but take key learnings, and algorithmic frameworks over a form finding framework

need to articulate thoughts better
