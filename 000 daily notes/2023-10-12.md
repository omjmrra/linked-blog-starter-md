Vittorio Gregotti provocatively suggested in 1983 that the origin of architecture was neither the primitive hut nor the cave: ‘Before transforming a support into a column, a roof into a tympanum, before placing a stone on a stone, man placed a stone on the ground to recognise the site in the midst of an unknown universe, in order to take account of it and modify it’.
