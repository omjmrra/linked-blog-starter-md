im sorry but everyone is doing it for themselves

anyone you tells you otherwise is lying

if you have freedoms and independence you are not united

if everyone is going to get it what is the point in the mandate 

why are we so desperately trying 6o extend our lives 

or end of suffering, because from suffer comes the most growth

okay your protesting

but the issue arises when you realize what you are asking for what is the resolution.

say the government listened and changed to no mandates. why should the indivial business not still require of customers? for it is the majority

what you need is to sway public opinion but you not going to do that by block roads and preventing business from opening,  you have to devillian yourself 

the government didn't ruin the economy, covid ruined the economy

what us happening is people are haplen and fed up, and combination theses feeling with other rhetoric 

make the statements clear and give reason

do not just point fingers

what businesses are we talking about here,

can't go to school, distance learn like what you expect of those unvaccinated

if the problem is not the Police but the protesters, then by the same token, it is not the protestors but the mandate
