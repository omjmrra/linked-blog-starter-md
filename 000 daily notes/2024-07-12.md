# Thoughts
processes are important  
  
  
have to do the project while improving the process, which is difficult but not impossible  
  
project deliverables (latest iteration)  
process (project specific)  
methodologies (accumulative)  
  
just start and update later  
delayed finalisation strategy  
  
Simple Layout  
  
  
can organise over time  
simple grid system  
simple heading subheading body annotation reference families.  
  
Possible layouts - question tutor about graphic design?  
  
  
sources of inspiration  
resources  
ask [[Daniel K Brown]] about methodologies
