not enough sleep
work aight
took photos an brought camera to work
saw [[@ Cassidy Stewart]]
ideas of [[Ethics]]
Became intrigued by notion of [[altruism]]
I didn’t have self sacrifice and personal worth
ideas of [[; Consumerism]] and [[Universal Suffering]]
duality in between two states which are called ignorance and analysis - [[Ignorant Analysis Continuum]]

I wouldn’t say I was fixing but this themes
I wouldn’t say self Contempt fuck are there is some idea that does do my actions outweigh the consequences of my existence

[[= not taking life seriously]]
alternative to ignorance is analysis and I believe that one cannot operate in society in a state of analysis

a desire to formulate coherent and I robust axioms
to derive [[Truth]]

One of the most potent ones is; the [[Ethics]] of whether actions should be justified by one self or others
for without others you lose meaning for oneself
reconsidering oneself you can lose others

is value placed in oneself or the perceived concept of them in others

I find myself pondering over ethics
[[= false ethics are something that I have issue with]]
