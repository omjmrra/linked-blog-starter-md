# Thoughts:
lost touch  
no reflections  
just living  
is that worse or better?  
feels like groundhog day  
can’t pass this hurdle  
entire simester is a right off  
stopped trying, stopped caring?  
procrastination max  
distraction to other  
lower standard  
low quality of work  
poor execution  
priorities, are in order?  
why  
why finish  
must finish  
can’t bail, feed stress  
avoidance of stress  
self destroying behaviour  
lost balance  
lost focus  
focus on other factors  
efficiency  
to sellout or to not sellout  
self control, self discipline  
balance  
lock in  
distraction  
avoidance
