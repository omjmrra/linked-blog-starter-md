the purpose of memory

think I am poor at verbally empathising, but can be good at empathising theoretically 
probably better at non-specific or devils advocate rather that empathising with the subject directly

conversations 16.06.22

across the room sat a child
nearly 17, yet a silent child
wise is the man who remains silent i thought
yet would a wise man not share his thought?
so across the room he sat
a wise man or a silenced boy i thought

is this a wild child i thought
is wild, silent child, violent

today this particular spirited man met 
he found such character refreshing 
such is the world that unfiltered conversation is taboo
such is the world that being yourself is refreshing

such is this world, that we cannot handle

even when confident of such, how does this spirt know whether his eyes are his own.
even if his eyes are his own, how does this spirit know if what he is seeing is from his eyes or others.
even if he determines that his eyes are his own, and it is from them that he has sight, 
will he indeed see that his eyes are just the eyes of others?
will he indeed see that his eyes are 

who am I, if not but my eyes, and so he thinks

be careful saying that you see what others see, if in fact you do not, 

worse yet saying to to others that which you do not, 

for you may end up losing your sight 

for you may get caught up

bias to self judgment

productivity and responsiveness
