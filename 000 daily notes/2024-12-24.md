##### Notes:



You get get good at what ever you spend the most time doing. 
A few years past, I claimed I would not do I job simply for money. 


I am in a sort of limbo with this manifesto... its a prerequisite, but I feel like I say that alot. Th word prerequisite I mean.


I mean there is meant to be some personal development as well. 



I feel like there is so little time.


Control the callousness. 


Work Harder. 

I see my mother in my actions


So buzzy how our inner voice. 


Scholarships 




I feel like I am not aware, because I am thinking from the first person.
Judgement
