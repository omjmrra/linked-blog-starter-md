exaggeration
underestimation or belittling

must set aside time to write each day in my break 

as a response to the motive of leaving…

reason one: to make the time spent more intentional or more valuable.
- i am in tow minds about this statement, on one hand yes living intentionally can be seen as positive, along with have meaningful time with others now.

- but on the other hand, what is preventing you from doing that now, there is nothing they can’t be done in the circumstances now,

- see reality can be hard to face but it is possible that the underlying truth may be found within

- the statement, “I always know what your doing, so it becomes boring.” that is the unfortunate truth of life and routine, a lot of life is just doing mostly the same thing, I think this choice to leave is enabling the notion of life through rose-tinted glasses. if you see people only once in a while, when you communicate, you see the façade that they show you, the same generic questions are answered in an equally “prescipted” fashion, its shallow and not a reality, 

maybe reality is really what scares you.
or maybe you are aware of this and that is why you are choosing to life
- you said that you have tried to make it work,

or it could be that you are genuinely sick of us

where does this path lead - 
don’t forsake responsibly 

arjun’s observations of me:
- how i laugh at life - don’t take things seriously, that everything is a joke to me
- calling people dusty utes - fair observation
- always feel judged. - why do a lot of people feel like i am judging them, is it how i present myself of is it there own insecurities.

psychoanalysis, reasoning why people are or act the way that they do, I try to block or ignore this, i don’t really want to know,

i have no basis to of relation

i would say that i try to see the long term in most of my actions, of what i have control over

lack of attachment - 
lack of substance
