What I want the building to be and do  
  
  
  
  pay attention to the scope of the project. how many people can occupy the space. don't design for the 99th occurrence but the the typical.  
  
site analysis carved out a set of limitations or constraints.  
while I have developed a list of desires
  
  
  
  
  
I needs to be:  
  
First and foremost a structure that provides shelter to the occupants.  
  
A form that suggest views to gaze outwards, in so doing, the suggested point of intent becoming a focus point for reflection. - focus points and movement of water  
  
A form that gives a subtle sense of awe when you enter.  
  
A form when viewed externally, its internal layout not be fully understood.  
  
A form that provides space for people to converse and partake in communal contemplation while providing areas forÂ  contemplative thought or focused study.  
  
A form pays attention the entrance, ideally extending a zone of decompression. There is a feeling I get when I am ascend that stairs if the school of philosophy.  
  
A structure that is accessible.  
  
A structure that has considered safety against both seismic and Strom events.  
  
A structure that has considered its ecological impact and end of life management.  
  
A structure that has been simplified to a form which satisfies the aforementioned goals without access.
