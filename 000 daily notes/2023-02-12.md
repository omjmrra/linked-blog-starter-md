Draft – study link application  
  
Points:  
Reasons for leaving  
Grades from first year and papers in first trimester.  
Rejoin for trimester two, did all the papers I could do without prerequisites. 1:1 elective.  
Motivated and excited for another change.  
  
To whom it concerns,  
I am writing this letter to explain my circumstances in order to support my student allowance application. Last year on (state), I made the decision to unenrolled from my trimester one papers. At this point, you can see from my records that I wasn’t feeling, rather than my reason for enrolment was on the basis of being in my best interest for assault, mentally compromised at that point.
