# Thoughts:

as I think about the future, have a face with a question of impermanence that are time on this planet is limited.  
  
As I think about university, I think of a time. There is a hidden pressure to go through life quickly. First year. I thought that this was nonsense, that was the norm, but it didn’t need to be bananas. I’m contemplating my future I’m faced. The question of time brings with it. I pressure what’s sad though that’s in my thoughts, I think of my mother how just like me, her time is limited and what gives life meaning? She would say maybe she would still say that I gave her life meaning, but my rejection of that relationship questions don’t reason.  
  
I don’t know why our relationship suffered I don’t know what the root causes yet that’s unfortunate because I see now I’m being a single parent and then your child rejecting you is fucked
