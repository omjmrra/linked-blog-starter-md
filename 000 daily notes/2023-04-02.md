The earliest gas lights were simple perforated shapes screwed on to the end of the gas pipes. These burners had names describing the shape of the flame produced. These included rat’s tail, cockspur, cocks comb, bat’s wing and fish tail, but the light produced was often poor. The incandescent gas mantle was invented in 1887 by Carl Auer, a chemist at Bunsen's laboratory in Heidelberg. The specially treated asbestos mantle gave a brighter and more steady light, adding to the demand for gas lighting in domestic premises. Although they were fragile, these mantles gave a much better light.

WATER GAS > GIRARD HOUSE > GASOMETER "This gas is generated from water and rosin, and as the vapour produced by these passes over a bed of burning charcoal, a portion of the carbon is taken up. Forty pounds of rosin are used to every thousand feet of gas, the quantity of charcoal being very small"
