#dailynote,

ideas behind being a role mode for kids
look into [[Feng Shui]]principles 

[[ = cancel culture as an inhibitor for freedom of speech as a function of society]]
[[- sin of commission vs sin of omission]]

i have become comfortable with antisocial behaviour
is this a bad thing 

[[= I think I have an expectation or and assumption of the future, of the possibility and potential holds that I don’t think I have an attachment to the present. is this healthy long term]]

[[= unbalanced relationship because idk if with most people I value them more than superficially]]

what i look for in meaningful [[Friendships]](s) is > [[Desired Qualities]]

curiosity
listening/perceptiveness 
lack of drama, some degree of acceptance
passionate
anti cancel culture - forgiveness and understanding
open mind

what do i want to do  
why ocean do you want to do it?

need someone to explain why [[Communism]] is wrong 

hopefully in a process of change now

[[= there is self praise or along the lines of up yourself - is this deceitful or honest or required by the need for gratification]]

[[! becoming egoless or not?]]

i feel like…
there is degrees of magnitude with respect to openness and acceptance

for i find that…
some have such a degree, or you can come to having such a degree of openness that things become existentially uncertain and chaos ensues

better to have an opinion in the arena of free speech while maintain openness to new ideas. however this comes with the responsibility of analysis and rigorous criticism 

rathe than the wilful disassociation with all that is reality if we accept the unknowingness
i think that just stating that we don’t know is no addition to the conversation 

it should be the underlying truth but not the subject of discussion 

disposition

in this case I believe I am acting in a way all people should act with some degree of kindness and perceptiveness, but maybe because this is not as common as it should be, it can be interpreted and specially treating some people and the value you more for it

maybe got to a point where I don't value this as much as they, and I'm being a little shit
