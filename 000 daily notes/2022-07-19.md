how does one find the space between acceptance, reassurance vs motivation or calling out.
in the context of compassion

I guess some would say that everybody is different and deals with things in their own respect.
I think this comes back to sensitivity

But on the other hand there is the idea that I really don't want people to validating my feelings and tell me that its okay even thought that is the formality, I would like the them call me out, spit straight facts.

the issue may be with self confidence and self esteem, and consequently the ability to bounce back, or rather the ability to take criticism.

I see the potential issue with this

treat other how you would like to be treated,
maybe that is only in a reductive/preventative respect.
maybe it does not mean do onto others what you would like done to you, but don't do onto others what you would not like to be done on you.

Plato would say:

one comes to crave that to which one has been accustomed 

not everybody has to like the same thing
