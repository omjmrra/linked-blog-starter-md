[[Introspection]] #introspection 
Yesterday I handed in SARC 223 Project a day late and not to the required standard.

This project was hard for me because I got caught up on the small things that I did not complete the work.

Furthermore YouTube has become an issue as I have been mindless scrolling and watching recently. [[YouTube]]

I am confused between whether to put my head down and focus fully on school work. Or prioritise other 'life' things.

I need to get back on track and become a good student.

Plan [[THE PLAN]]
- Catch up on work I am behind on
- Stop watching YouTube
- Read in spare time
- Get to bed earlier [[Ritual of Sleep]]
- Put door on room to get in a focus mode.
- Reflect Daily
- Go to tutorials - actually sack up and do work beforehand. [[System of Learning]]
